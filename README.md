# tensorflow-tastic

*playing with tensorflow*

welcome! this repo is for executable notebooks demonstrating single (or as close to it as i can get!) concepts in Tensorflow.

*why?*

because machine learning projects, and deep learning projects in particular, have a lot of moving parts! building a project is an excellent way to learn. but when i was learning, i noticed there weren't a lot of freely available, __simple__ resources that focused on familiarity with single concepts. i was looking for a way to learn my way around Tensorflow without also having to learn a lot of new concepts *at the same time*. 

__sometimes it's instructive to focus on one thing at a time.__

so i will be uploading more single-focus demo notebooks here as i make them, just in case someone else might find them helpful. check back!

### thanks and have a nice day!
